## Lecture 1

Prof. Anderson is asking us to create a repo on GitHub and take notes in Markdown. I'm not sure how I feel about this.

Markdown: Need a volunteer to create a presentation about Markdown. Cover basic Markdown... and GitHub's extensions to Markdown.

What do you think about when you hear BigData? Social Networks, data analytics (with many categories i.e. sampling all the way to various classes of machine learning), storage(NoSQL -> came from people having issues with relational database structure. SQL is great when you have a schema for data. NoSQL works better for unstructured data and returning fast results, not very good at doing arbitrary querys.) In NoSQL there are document databases, graph databases, colomnar, key-value stores

Data Modeling is WICKED HARD

There is a space called Data Collection and Cleaning.

Statistics comes bag in BigData analytics. Statistics is built on sampling.

InfoViz: Have huge datasets, how do you display them to the user? D3- javascript framework that helps you do visualizations in the browser. Tabluea, Excell, R are some more examples.

Data Life Cycle: What is your question- curation, triage(medical term for who needs treatment, or resources, more than others), persistance, Collection generation, clean up, storage, processing/analysis. -> query and visualize or ACT -> gives you new questions.
